# I Can Do Anything
This repository is a shush to the thinking that things are too hard. The people at the top and their positions are unachievable by the likes of normal people. Basically the thought that If the people at the top are humans and I am human as well, then the only thing stopping me is the inferiority complex and the lack of consistent efforts. 

At the moment while creating this repo and writing this description, I had left my job at NSE, I'm unemployed, and the place where I lack would be Data Structures and Algorithms and System Design. So let me start my consistent effort here. I am just keeping this as a place to come back every day and keep myself accountable. 

In my personal life as well, I used to be super productive, used to exercise, cycle, boxing and always keep myself occupied. Because of stress and my medical condition, I am being limited from my potential most of the times. I don't want to let all of this come in the way, instead I want to become an inspiration for such people. I want to cross boundaries, fear etc because most of it is just in the mind.

One thing that I wanna achieve in this process is to land a Job at the biggest tech companies that are deemed to be impossible or super hard to crack. Its just the inferiority complex that is stopping me and my potential. I want to live upto my potential.

- I wanted to take baby steps in the beginning. Add waking up early, cycling, meditation, DSA and System Design to my daily routine.
